# Recognition-Awards
I received the "Pat on the Back" award for my outstanding contributions to the eMotorad project. Over a span of just three weeks, I played a pivotal role in steering the project to success. My commitment to excellence was evident in the ownership of tasks and the meticulous approach I brought to every aspect of the project.
